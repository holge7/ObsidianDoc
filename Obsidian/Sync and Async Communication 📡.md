## Synchronous communication

Sync communication happens in real-time, and this operations are performed one at a time. One task finishes the next step begins.

In Synchronous transmission, there s no gap present between data. It is more efficient and more reliable than async transmission to transfer a large amount of data

Examples: Chat Rooms, Telephonic Conversations, Video Conferencing, etc.


## Asynchronous communication

Async opertaions can happen at the same time and without real-time, you can move to the next step while another step finishes

In async transmission, data is sent ini form of byte or character. This transmission s the half-duplex type transmission. In this transmission start bits and stop bits are added with data. It does not requiere synchronization
